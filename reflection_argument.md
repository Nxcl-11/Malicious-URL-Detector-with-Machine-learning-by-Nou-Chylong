# Reflection & Argument

Developing this detector underscored the power of feature engineering in cybersecurity classification tasks. The Random Forest delivered strong performance on structured URL features, proving its practicality for near‑real‑time defense.  

Looking ahead, I plan to trial deep‑learning architectures to capture subtler, higher‑order URL patterns, and to integrate streaming data for live detection, further boosting adaptability against emerging threats.
