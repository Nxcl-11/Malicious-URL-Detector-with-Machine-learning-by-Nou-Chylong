# Reflection & Argument

This project helped me understand the vital role feature engineering plays in classification tasks. Detecting malicious URLs is not only about achieving high accuracy, but also about ensuring the model provides meaningful impact in real-world cybersecurity scenarios. The Random Forest model performed effectively in identifying threats based on engineered features, confirming its strength in structured datasets.


However, this project also opened my eyes to the possibilities beyond traditional models. In the future, I plan to experiment with neural networks to explore their potential in capturing deeper, more complex patterns hidden within URL structures. By integrating real-time URL stream analysis and applying advanced techniques like deep learning, I believe the system can be made more adaptive and accurate in handling evolving cyber threats.
